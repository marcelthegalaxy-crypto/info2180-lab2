        <h2>Days of the Past</h2>
        <p>This was a period where I felt somewhat lost a stage in my life when I wasn’t fully serious. I still produced acceptable results, though not outstanding by my own standards. But it was during this time that the foundations were being refined, and things slowly began to sharpen into focus.</p>
